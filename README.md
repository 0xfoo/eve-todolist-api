# Eve-Todolist-API (deprecated)
Stumbling over [eve - Python REST API Framework](http://python-eve.org/) it
seemed interesting enough to give it a try.

So I started to try to build a simple API for a todolist application, but I
felt that eve wasn't really helping the areas where a API framework should.
That is the level of abstraction to me seems off.

Admittedly I only have written very few lines, but the docs are also sparse,
this it seemed unwise to put any more time into it.

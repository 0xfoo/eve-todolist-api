# Eve-Todolist-API (deprecated)
Stumbling over [eve - Python REST API Framework](http://python-eve.org/) it
seemed interesting enough to give it a try.

So I started builing a simple API for a todolist application, but
felt that eve wasn't really helping in the areas where a API framework should.
By that I mean the level of abstraction seems off and you end up not writing
not pythonic code but some weird config to interface with the database.

Admittedly I've written very few lines, but the docs are also sparse,
thus it seemed unwise to put any more time into it.
